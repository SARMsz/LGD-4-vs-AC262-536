<h1>LGD-4 vs AC262,536: My Real Experience Testing These SARMs</h1>

<p>When it comes to trying out new SARMs, I always go hands-on before I give my opinion. I’ve run multiple cycles with both <strong>LGD-4</strong> and <strong>AC262,536</strong>, testing them solo and stacked. In this post, I’m breaking down everything I’ve learned — effects, side effects, results, and which is worth your time (and money).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I personally used both of these from Chemyo because they’re one of the few companies that actually third-party test their stuff. Here are the links to what I used:</p>

<h2>What Are These SARMs?</h2>

<h3>LGD-4 (Ligandrol Derivative)</h3>
<p>LGD-4 is the next-gen version of LGD-4033. It’s designed to be just as strong for muscle building, but with fewer androgenic side effects. Think of it as a cleaner, slightly more refined Ligandrol.</p>

<h3>AC262,536 (Accadrine)</h3>
<p>AC262,536 is a newer SARM that’s still in early research, but it's gaining hype. It's more selective than traditional SARMs and doesn’t bind to androgen receptors in the prostate or other non-muscle tissues as strongly. That’s a big deal if you care about minimizing side effects.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Compared LGD-4 vs AC262,536</h2>

<p>I ran each compound for a solo 6-week cycle at research dosages, with a 4-week break in between. Diet was consistent: high-protein, moderate-carb, low-fat. No other SARMs or anabolic compounds were used during the test.</p>

<p>I tracked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weight changes</li>
  <li>Strength progression</li>
  <li>Muscle fullness</li>
  <li>Side effects (acne, libido, energy, sleep)</li>
  <li>Recovery after training</li>
</ul>

<h2>My LGD-4 Experience</h2>

<p>I ran LGD-4 at 10mg/day for 6 weeks. By the end of week 2, I already noticed a big boost in muscle pumps and strength. Weight increased by around 6 lbs total by the end of the cycle. Not bloat — lean size. Strength went up on all my lifts, especially bench and squats.</p>

<p>The gains felt dry and clean. No water retention, no weird crashes. Recovery between workouts was insane — I could hit the same muscle group 2-3 times a week without feeling beat up.</p>

<p>The downside? Slight suppression by week 5. My libido dipped a bit and sleep was slightly off. But nothing like the heavy shutdown I got from RAD-140 in the past. PCT brought me back to baseline in 3 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Bulking, recomposition, strength cycles</p>

<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 10mg/day (oral solution)</p>

<h2>My AC262,536 Experience</h2>

<p>I ran AC262,536 at 30mg/day for 6 weeks. It took longer to kick in compared to LGD-4 — around 2.5 to 3 weeks. But once it did, the results felt more natural and steady.</p>

<p>I gained about 3.5 lbs total, but the muscle looked dense and dry. No bloat at all. Endurance and vascularity improved too — similar to how I felt on mild Cardarine. Pumps were solid in the gym, but not as insane as LGD-4.</p>

<p>The best part? <strong>No noticeable suppression</strong>. Libido stayed normal, sleep was good, and mood was steady the entire time. That’s what really impressed me.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, body recomposition, first-time users</p>

<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 30mg/day (oral solution)</p>

<p><strong>Where I got it:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/ac-262-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AC262,536 from Chemyo</a></p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minimal to no suppression</li>
  <li>Good for cutting and recomposition</li>
  <li>Improves vascularity and endurance</li>
  <li>Cleaner feel overall</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gains are slower</li>
  <li>Less strength compared to LGD-4</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AC262,536</strong> is better if you’re cutting, recomping, or don’t want to deal with post-cycle therapy. It’s smoother, safer for beginners, and easier on the body.</p>
